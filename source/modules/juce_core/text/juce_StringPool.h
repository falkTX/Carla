/**
    A StringPool holds a set of shared strings, which reduces storage overheads and improves
    comparison speed when dealing with many duplicate strings.

    When you add a string to a pool using getPooledString, it'll return a character
    array containing the same string. This array is owned by the pool, and the same array
    is returned every time a matching string is asked for. This means that it's trivial to
    compare two pooled strings for equality, as you can simply compare their pointers. It
    also cuts down on storage if you're using many copies of the same string.
