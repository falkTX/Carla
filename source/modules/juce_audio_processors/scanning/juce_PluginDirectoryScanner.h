        Creates a scanner.

        @param listToAddResultsTo       this will get the new types added to it.
        @param formatToLookFor          this is the type of format that you want to look for
        @param directoriesToSearch      the path to search
        @param searchRecursively        true to search recursively
        @param deadMansPedalFile        if this isn't File(), then it will be used as a file
                                        to store the names of any plugins that crash during
                                        initialisation. If there are any plugins listed in it,
                                        then these will always be scanned after all other possible
                                        files have been tried - in this way, even if there's a few
                                        dodgy plugins in your path, then a couple of rescans
                                        will still manage to find all the proper plugins.
                                        It's probably best to choose a file in the user's
                                        application data directory (alongside your app's
                                        settings file) for this. The file format it uses
                                        is just a list of filenames of the modules that
                                        failed.
       @param allowPluginsWhichRequireAsynchronousInstantiation
                                        If this is false then the scanner will exclude plug-ins
                                        asynchronous creation - such as AUv3 plug-ins.
