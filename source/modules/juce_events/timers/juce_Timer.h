/**
    Makes repeated callbacks to a virtual method at a specified time interval.

    A Timer's timerCallback() method will be repeatedly called at a given
    interval. When you create a Timer object, it will do nothing until the
    startTimer() method is called, which will cause the message thread to
    start making callbacks at the specified interval, until stopTimer() is called
    or the object is deleted.

    The time interval isn't guaranteed to be precise to any more than maybe
    10-20ms, and the intervals may end up being much longer than requested if the
    system is busy. Because the callbacks are made by the main message thread,
    anything that blocks the message queue for a period of time will also prevent
    any timers from running until it can carry on.

    If you need to have a single callback that is shared by multiple timers with
    different frequencies, then the MultiTimer class allows you to do that - its
    structure is very similar to the Timer class, but contains multiple timers
    internally, each one identified by an ID number.
