/**
    A type of timer class that can run multiple timers with different frequencies,
    all of which share a single callback.

    This class is very similar to the Timer class, but allows you run multiple
    separate timers, where each one has a unique ID number. The methods in this
    class are exactly equivalent to those in Timer, but with the addition of
    this ID number.

    To use it, you need to create a subclass of MultiTimer, implementing the
    timerCallback() method. Then you can start timers with startTimer(), and
    each time the callback is triggered, it passes in the ID of the timer that
    caused it.
