/**
    Expresses a coordinate as a dynamically evaluated expression.

    When using relative coordinates to position components, the following symbols are available:
     - "left", "right", "top", "bottom" refer to the position of those edges in this component, so
       e.g. for a component whose width is always 100, you might set the right edge to the "left + 100".
     - "[id].left", "[id].right", "[id].top", "[id].bottom", "[id].width", "[id].height", where [id] is
       the identifier of one of this component's siblings. A component's identifier is set with
       Component::setComponentID(). So for example if you want your component to always be 50 pixels to the
       right of the one called "xyz", you could set your left edge to be "xyz.right + 50".
     - Instead of an [id], you can use the name "parent" to refer to this component's parent. Like
       any other component, these values are relative to their component's parent, so "parent.right" won't be
       very useful for positioning a component because it refers to a position with the parent's parent.. but
       "parent.width" can be used for setting positions relative to the parent's size. E.g. to make a 10x10
       component which remains 1 pixel away from its parent's bottom-right, you could use
       "right - 10, bottom - 10, parent.width - 1, parent.height - 1".
     - The name of one of the parent component's markers can also be used as a symbol. For markers to be
       used, the parent component must implement its Component::getMarkers() method, and return at least one
       valid MarkerList. So if you want your component's top edge to be 10 pixels below the
       marker called "foobar", you'd set it to "foobar + 10".

    See the Expression class for details about the operators that are supported, but for example
    if you wanted to make your component remains centred within its parent with a size of 100, 100,
    you could express it as:
    @code myComp.setBounds (RelativeBounds ("parent.width / 2 - 50, parent.height / 2 - 50, left + 100, top + 100"));
    @endcode
    ..or an alternative way to achieve the same thing:
    @code myComp.setBounds (RelativeBounds ("right - 100, bottom - 100, parent.width / 2 + 50, parent.height / 2 + 50"));
    @endcode

    Or if you wanted a 100x100 component whose top edge is lined up to a marker called "topMarker" and
    which is positioned 50 pixels to the right of another component called "otherComp", you could write:
    @code myComp.setBounds (RelativeBounds ("otherComp.right + 50, topMarker, left + 100, top + 100"));
    @endcode

    Be careful not to make your coordinate expressions recursive, though, or exceptions and assertions will
    be thrown!
