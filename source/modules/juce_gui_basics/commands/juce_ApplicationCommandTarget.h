    A command target publishes a list of command IDs that it can perform.

    An ApplicationCommandManager despatches commands to targets, which must be
    able to provide information about what commands they can handle.

    To create a target, you'll need to inherit from this class, implementing all of
    its pure virtual methods.

    For info about how a target is chosen to receive a command, see
    ApplicationCommandManager::getFirstCommandTarget().
