    A factory object which can create ToolbarItemComponent objects.

    A subclass of ToolbarItemFactory publishes a set of types of toolbar item
    that it can create.

    Each type of item is identified by a unique ID, and multiple instances of an
    item type can exist at once (even on the same toolbar, e.g. spacers or separator
    bars).
