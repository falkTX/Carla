/**
    Controls the order in which keyboard focus moves between components.

    The default behaviour of this class uses a FocusTraverser object internally to
    determine the default/next/previous component until it finds one which wants
    keyboard focus, as set by the Component::setWantsKeyboardFocus() method.

    If you need keyboard focus traversal in a more customised way, you can create
    a subclass of ComponentTraverser that uses your own algorithm, and use
    Component::createKeyboardFocusTraverser() to create it.
