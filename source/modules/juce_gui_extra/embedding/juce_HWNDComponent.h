    A Windows-specific class that can create and embed a HWND inside itself.

    To use it, create one of these, put it in place and make sure it's visible in a
    window, then use setHWND() to assign a HWND to it. The window will then be
    moved and resized to follow the movements of this component.

    Of course, since the window is a native object, it'll obliterate any
    JUCE components that may overlap this component, but that's life.
