=====================================================================

I've incorporated Ogg-Vorbis directly into the Juce codebase because it makes
things much easier than having to make all your builds link correctly to
the appropriate libraries on every different platform.

I've made minimal changes to the Ogg-Vorbis code - just tweaked a few include 
paths to make it build smoothly, and added some headers to allow you to exclude 
it from the build.

=====================================================================

The following license is the BSD-style license that comes with the
Ogg-Vorbis distribution, and which applies just to the header files I've
included in this directory. For more info, and to get the rest of the
distribution, visit the Ogg-Vorbis homepage: www.vorbis.com
