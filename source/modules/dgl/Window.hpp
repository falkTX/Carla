/**
   DGL Window class.

   This is the where all OS-related events initially happen, before being propagated to any widgets.

   A Window MUST have an Application instance tied to it.
   It is not possible to swap Application instances from within the lifetime of a Window.
   But it is possible to completely change the Widgets that a Window contains during its lifetime.

   Typically the event handling functions as following:
   Application -> Window -> Top-Level-Widget -> SubWidgets

   Please note that, unlike many other graphical toolkits out there,
   DGL makes a clear distinction between a Window and a Widget.
   You cannot directly draw in a Window, you need to create a Widget for that.

   Also, a Window MUST have a single top-level Widget.
   The Window will take care of global screen positioning and resizing, everything else is sent for widgets to handle.

   /**
      Window graphics context as a scoped struct.
      This class gives graphics context drawing time to a window's widgets.
      Typically used for allowing OpenGL drawing operations during a window + widget constructor.

      Unless you are subclassing the Window or StandaloneWindow classes, you do not need to care.
      In such cases you will need to use this struct as a way to get a valid OpenGL context.
      For example in a standalone application:
      ```
      int main()
      {
          Application app;
          Window win(app);
          ScopedPointer<MyCustomTopLevelWidget> widget;
          {
              const Window::ScopedGraphicsContext sgc(win);
              widget = new MyCustomTopLevelWidget(win);
          }
          app.exec();
          return 0;
      }
      ```

      This struct is necessary because we cannot automatically make the window leave the OpenGL context in custom code.
      And we must always cleanly enter and leave the OpenGL context.
      So in order to avoid messing up the global host context, this class is used around widget creation.
