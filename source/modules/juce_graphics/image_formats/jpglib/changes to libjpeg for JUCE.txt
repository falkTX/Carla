
I've included libjpeg in the JUCE tree because loading jpegs is a pretty useful thing to
be able to do, but I've left out as many files as possible to keep it lean-and-mean.

If you want to get hold of the full version of libjpeg, it's freely available at:

http://www.ijg.org/


Please note that part of the IJG's license for libjpeg states that:

  "If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in 
   your documentation that you've used the IJG code".

..so if you release a JUCE program that reads JPEGs, you should probably give them a mention.
