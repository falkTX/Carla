    An image that will be resampled before it is drawn.

    A plain Image only stores plain pixels, but does not store any information
    about how these pixels correspond to points. This means that if the image's
    dimensions are interpreted as points, then the image will be blurry when
    drawn on high resolution displays. If the image's dimensions are instead
    interpreted as corresponding to exact pixel positions, then the logical
    size of the image will change depending on the scale factor of the screen
    used to draw it.

    The ScaledImage class is designed to store an image alongside a scale
    factor that informs a renderer how to convert between the image's pixels
    and points.
