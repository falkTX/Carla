/**
    This class holds a pointer which is automatically deleted when this object goes
    out of scope.

    Once a pointer has been passed to a ScopedPointer, it will make sure that the pointer
    gets deleted when the ScopedPointer is deleted. Using the ScopedPointer on the stack or
    as member variables is a good way to use RAII to avoid accidentally leaking dynamically
    created objects.

    A ScopedPointer can be used in pretty much the same way that you'd use a normal pointer
    to an object. If you use the assignment operator to assign a different object to a
    ScopedPointer, the old one will be automatically deleted.

    A const ScopedPointer is guaranteed not to lose ownership of its object or change the
    object to which it points during its lifetime. This means that making a copy of a const
    ScopedPointer is impossible, as that would involve the new copy taking ownership from the
    old one.

    If you need to get a pointer out of a ScopedPointer without it being deleted, you
    can use the release() method.

    Something to note is the main difference between this class and the std::auto_ptr class,
    which is that ScopedPointer provides a cast-to-object operator, whereas std::auto_ptr
    requires that you always call get() to retrieve the pointer. The advantages of providing
    the cast is that you don't need to call get(), so can use the ScopedPointer in pretty much
    exactly the same way as a raw pointer. The disadvantage is that the compiler is free to
    use the cast in unexpected and sometimes dangerous ways - in particular, it becomes difficult
    to return a ScopedPointer as the result of a function. To avoid this causing errors,
    ScopedPointer contains an overloaded constructor that should cause a syntax error in these
    circumstances, but it does mean that instead of returning a ScopedPointer from a function,
    you'd need to return a raw pointer (or use a std::auto_ptr instead).
