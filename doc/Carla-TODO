# Carla TODO

CODE CLEANUP:
 - Smarter audio/midi port names (count == 1: "audio-in" else: "audio-in-x")

GENERAL:
 - add direct program access on ui-dialogs (needed for standalone bridges), maybe add extra buttons too (reset plugin, fix ui size)
 - implement osc-based uis in bridge mode
 - implement midi-learn (new dialog)
 - implement midi-cc automation special rules (invert, half, logarithmic, etc)
 - allow to change position of plugins (up/down)

ENGINE:
 - complete RtAudio+RtMidi support
 - implement Haiku Media support (based from JACK?)
 - implement latency in continuous-rack mode
 - DSSI/LV2/VST version (needs add-new support on control side)
 - Handle sample-rate changes in JACK (made possible by switch-master)

LADSPA:
 - on reload() only set def,min,max after all changes, apply to dssi and lv2

DSSI:

LV2:
 - implement lv2-preset support
 - implement lv2-time messages support
 - complete lv2-atom messages support
 - complete lv2-worker support

VST:
 - add support for old X11 UIs
 - implement cockos extensions
 - compare with dssi-vst code

LinuxSampler:
 - implement midi-program changes

FluidSynth:

Native:
 - Cleanup API
 - Document API
